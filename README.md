  ## Installation

  ## Usage
  To use this generator you will need to first have Node installed on your machine.  Once you have cloned the repo and followed the installation instructions above simply answer the prompted questions to begin filling in your README.  If you need to add or change prompted information locally you can do so in the index.js file by adding more prompts to the inquirer.prompts and then editing the generateMarkdown function to include your new prompts in the output.

  ## Contribution
  If you want to add features or make changes you can fork this repo to your GitHub profile and again follow the installation instructions.  From there make your changes like you would for any other repo.
